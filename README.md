# Welcome to secret society

This is a website for those who want to distinguish aliens from ghosts, and other secret beings using deep learning.

Deep learning models are trained using [FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and hosted on [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/galopyz/Alien_vs_Ghost).

There are still other secret beings out there that need to be carefully studied.
